# Idiomatic-Expressions-Identification

A sentence is said to be an idiom when its literal and contextual meanings are different. These forms of statements play an important function in the tasks of information abstraction and tasks associated with system understanding. There is a lack of available datasets for training and testing this problem of identifying the nature of sentence, whether it is Literal or Contextual. Knowing their ability of non-literal behaviour and the capacity to take multiple means relying on the context, theyâ€™ve proved as an emerging challenge in NLP systems. To address this challenge we detect whether or not the sentence used is idiomatic in its context or not. Previous attempts at this problem used contextual and non-contextual approaches. Taking a lesson from the ones we suggest a model which makes use of Contextual in addition to Static Embeddings for the Idiomatic Expressions Identification Task. The method proposed uses a multi-stage neural network architecture to solve the problem. The network effectively fuses static and contextual meanings of each sentence and generates an embedding which is further given as input to the next layer. The final output obtained is the probability of the sentence being used in the literal or contextual form.
